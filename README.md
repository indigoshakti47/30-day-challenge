# 30-day-challenge
30 Day vanilla javascript challenge
# Drum Kit
In this first challenge we will build a Drum Kit with the letters A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L . Each of which will play a different sound and cause a small animation that will let the user know which key was pressed. 

# Clock
Simple clock interface.

# Basic Image Effects
Through the use of two sliders (spacing, blur) and a color picker we will be able to transform some CSS properties of a random image and it's container.
